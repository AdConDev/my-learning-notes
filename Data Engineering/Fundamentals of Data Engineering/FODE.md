# Fundamentals of Data Engineering

## Part 1: Foundations and Building Blocks

### Chapter 1: Data Engineering Described

Data Engineering builds the foundation for data science and analytics in production. This chapter explores what data engineering is, how the field was born and its evolution, the skills of data engineers, and with whom they work.

#### What is Data Engineering?

#### Data Engineering Defined

Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.
